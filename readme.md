### Whatsapp:
If you need help, please visit the [Whatsapp Support](https://chat.whatsapp.com/ELM9aLYegRC0dMid7Xa5hH). Our issue tracker is not a support whatsapp, and using it as one will result in your issue being closed.

### Issues:
We use the [issue tracker on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/johncore/OpenTibia-Premium/issues). Keep in mind that everyone who is watching the repository gets notified by e-mail when there is activity, so be thoughtful and avoid writing comments that aren't meaningful for an issue (e.g. "+1"). If you'd like for an issue to be fixed faster, you should either fix it yourself and submit a pull request, or place a bounty on the issue.
